# Health DSS Dash App 

This the Health DSS Dash App - a data analysis, data visualization, and Dash application development. This is an interactive, user friendly dashboard that provides services to multiple stakeholders. Using the multiple data sets to be collected from different health sectors, we can do in-depth data analysis, interactive data visualization, and an app that has predictive analytics and virtual assistance.

### Business Understanding & Data Acquisition
The datasets can be found [here]((https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/data?select=train.json.zip)).
- `train.json`: the training set.
- `images_sample.zip`: listing images organized by listing_id (a sample of 100 listings)
- `Kaggle-renthop.7z`: listing images organized by listing_id. Total size: 78.5 GB compressed.

**Note**: for this project, we will consider the training dataset as a full-dataset, as our goal is not to beat the competition, but to build a tool for data analysis and usages.

### Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Using various techniques
- Tabular Feature Extraction.
- Sentimental Extraction via HuggingFace's pretrained BERT (benchmark on SST dataset).
- Image Feature Extraction via PyTorch's YOLO.v5.

### EDA
Explore the dataset, reveal underlying information by plotting static plots for processed features. Here's the list of analysis: `outlider detection & removal`, `PCA`, `statistical test` (K-S, Shapiro-Witt, D'K^2), `Bar plot`, `Count plot`, `Pie chart`, `Distribution plot`, `Pair plot`, `Heatmap`, `Histogram with KDE`, `QQ plot`, `KDE`, `Regression plot with scatter representation and regression line`, `Boxen plot`, `Area plot`, `Violin plot`, `Joint plot with KDE and scatter representation`, `Rug plot`, `3D plot`, `Contour plot`, `Cluster map`, `Hexbin`, `Strip plot`, `Swarm plot`, `Subplots`.

### ML Modeling
I used Sklearn's SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, MLP, KNN.
- **Type 1**: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the interest level. 
- **Type 2**: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the interest level.
- **Type 3**: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the price. 
- **Type 4**: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the price.
